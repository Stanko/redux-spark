# Redux Spark

# Deprecation notice

Back when we created Spark, the whole React ecosystem was younger and we really needed a library like this. But Redux (and React) tooling evolved, and we feel like it is no longer the case.

This repository will remain available for posterity, but moving forward no new features will be added or maintenance taking place. You probably want to check [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/), official and opinionated tooling for Redux.

## What is this?

Spark is a thin wrapper around [redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [redux-saga](https://redux-saga.js.org/). We tried to reduce boilerplate code in react/redux/saga applications. Instead of writing action types, action creators, sagas and reducer, Spark allows you to call a single function and generate everything under the hood.

If you want to customize anything, only thing you need to write is a reducer (again, everything else is generated). There is a lot of customizable options, so we think it covers a lot of use cases. If you still need something that is not supported, it plays nicely with a standard reducer/saga/types/creators setup.

## Example

Spark comes with pre built generator. `generateAsyncReducer` accepts two params - reducer's name and function that returns a promise. Hopefully [live example](http://muffinman.io/redux-spark/) will make it clearer.

```js
import { generateAsyncReducer } from 'redux-spark';
import api from '../api';

// api.getUsers returns a promise
const actionCreators = generateAsyncReducer('users', api.getUsers);

export const {
  get,
  reset,
} = actionCreators;
```

Code above generates:

* Four actions types - one for `reset` action and three for async `get` action
* Two action creators - `get` and `reset`
* Saga and watcher - for async `get` action using `getLatest`
* Reducer function - with the following state:
  ```js
  {
    // data returned from api.getUsers
    data: object,
    // error if api.getUsers fails
    error: object,
    // loading indicators
    loading: boolean,
    // all params passed to "get" action (i.g. pagination offset and per page)
    params: object,
  }
  ```

You can write your generators, we advise you to check the source in [generate-async-reducer.ts](https://github.com/Stanko/redux-spark/blob/master/src/spark/generate-async-reducer.ts), it should be pretty self explanatory.

## Custom reducer

```js
import { Reducer } from 'redux-spark';
import api from './api';

// Create app reducer
const global = new Reducer('global', {
  isModalActive: false,
  settings: null,
  settingsError: null,
  settingsLoading: false,
});

// Add sync action
export const toggleModal = global.addAction('toggleModal', (state:any, action:any) => {
  return {
    ...state,
    isModalActive: !state.isModalActive,
  };
});

// Add async action
export const getSettings = global.addAsyncAction('getSettings', api.getSettings, {
  start: (state:any, action:any) => {
    return {
      ...state,
      settings: null,
      settingsError: null,
      settingsLoading: true,
    };
  },
  error: (state:any, action:any) => {
    return {
      ...state,
      settingsError: action.error,
      settingsLoading: false,
    };
  },
  success: (state:any, action:any) => {
    return {
      ...state,
      settings: action.data,
      settingsLoading: false,
    };
  },
});
```

## API

Before diving into API, be sure to check examples above.

### Spark core

#### Reducers

`getAllReducers` method will return array containing all of the generated reducers. You need to add it to your root reducer (only once).

```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';
import spark from 'redux-spark';

export default combineReducers({
  // You can put any additional reducers here
  ...spark.getAllReducers(),
});
```

PLEASE NOTE you'll need to import your reducer files somewhere, so they are executed and registered in the spark core. If you want to do it manually, you can always get a single reducer using it's built in method `.getReducerFunction()`


```js
import { combineReducers } from 'redux';

// Import spark reducer classes
import users from './users';
import groups from './groups';

export default combineReducers({
  // You can put any additional reducers here

  // Call "getReducerFunction" to get reducer function from spark
  users: users.getReducerFunction(),
  groups: groups.getReducerFunction(),
});
```

#### Sagas

Same thing for sagas. `getAllSagas` will return an array containing all of the generated sagas. You need to yield them in your root saga.

```js
import { all } from 'redux-saga/effects';
import spark from 'redux-spark';

export default function* rootSaga() {
  yield all([
    // You can put any additional sagas here
    ...spark.getAllSagas(),
  ]);
}
```

### Async Reducer Generator

### Reducer

  * Constructor
    * `name` string
    * `initialState` any type (you can use plain object or for example Immutable instance)

    Returns `Reducer` instance.

  * `addAction`
    * `actionName` string, camel cased (e.g. `toggleModal`, generated action type will be `TOGGLE_MODAL`).
    * `handler` reducer function with two params `state` and `action`.

    Returns action creator function.

  * `addAsyncAction`
    * `actionName` string, camel cased (e.g. `getUsers`, generated action types will be `GET_USERS_START`, `GET_USERS_SUCCESS`, `GET_USERS_ERROR`).
    * `asyncMethod` function that returns a promise. This promise will be resolved in the generated saga creator, and data returned to the handler.
    * `handlers` map (object) with `start/success/end` keys, each being reducer function with two params `state` and `action`. Each handler responds to one of the three generated actions.
    * `sagaOptions` object, if you want to customize saga effect *or* pass a custom saga, you need to pass it in this object.
      * Custom effect:
        ```js
        { effect: takeEvery }
        ```
      * Custom saga creator (it needs to be a function, so Spark can pass object with generated action types).
        ```js
        { sagaCreator: (actionsTypes) => yourCustomSaga }
        ```
        `actionsTypes` is an object with `start/success/end` keys, each one corresponding to the action type. (e.g. `GET_USERS_START`, `GET_USERS_SUCCESS`, `GET_USERS_ERROR`)

    Returns action creator function.

    By default generated saga will use `takeLatest` effect.

## Development

Quick start:

```
npm start
```

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). Check their default [readme](RCA-README.md).
